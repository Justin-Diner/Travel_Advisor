### Travel Advisor Application

Find local restaurants in your area. Currently, zoom in and out around your area to identify different rated restaurants. This application fetches data from two APIs.  First, use the Google Maps API to go any area in the world. The application will fetch data in real time from a restaurants API. That API displays actual restaurants and ratings!
